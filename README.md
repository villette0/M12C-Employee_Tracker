# Employee Tracker

## Application Description
This application interface is a content management system (CMS). It allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information in a database. In this case, if a manager wanted to interact with the employee, department, or job role information in the MySQL database, they can add, view, or update it via prompts in the terminal.  

## Challenge Description
The application is started using 'npm start' or 'node server.js' and uses the node modules of inquirer for prompts, mysql2 for adding table information, and console.table for displaying the tables to the user. The challenge required first building a mysql database via a schema and seeds which can be found in the db folder. The tables in this database include departments, roles, and employees. Some of the ids for each are primary keys and corresponding foreign keys for others. This way roles can be assigned departments, employees can be assigned roles, and employees can be assigned manager from other employees. To view these tables a simple select query method is used in the server.js JavaScript file. However to add and update information from the table, an array is used to pull data from the tables dynamically (since the information changes with each command) and then write that data from the array into newly generated tables via another insert query that passes string interpolated parameters. Each time information is added, the user is given confirmation in the console and then shown the new table information. Finally, the user can quit the application and given a thank you message.
